Also cited from Heyse (1979:31-32) as the highest occurrence of  Last Interglacial intertidal (clay laminated sand; Moerkerke beds) / supratidal facies (rooted sand laminated clayes: Meetkerke beds). Meetkerke beds have a top at +2.5 m TAW (=+0.17m TAW+2.33). Where Moerkerke/Meetkerke complex occurs above 0 m TAW (above -2.33 m TAW+2.33), it is as a horizontal surface. Where it reaches below 0, it has a ravinement contact at the base (subtidal facies). The marine (= brackish, estuarine) facies locally overlies fluvial (freshwater mollusca) facies (Oostwinkel beds/member), especially along the southern rim of the Scheldt palaeo-estuary where tributary brooks joined it locally. 

Upper and Lower limit analogy: In the modern Western Scheldt estuary (Medieval origin ingression) tidal range is 5 m at the estuary mouth, and increases inland over the first 30-40 km of estuary funneling.

This major reef and terrace association has its inner margin at a maximum height of 63 m above LWL, although locally this margin lies as low as 60 m above LWL. The framework contains many isolated large corals in growth position: the largest measured head was a Diploastrea heliopora 2.2 m in diameter. The inner margin of the reef wedge is a typical shallow-water assemblage similar to that at the rear of reef lb. A cobble pavement is widespread on the terrace surface, mingling with truncated and broken framework coral's beneath. Reef 2 stratigraphy is more complex west of Berau, and three units are recognized. The main body of the reef (reef 2-main) overlies an older reef that climbs inland to meet reef 3 but does not appear to merge with it . This older reef (reef 2-lower) is distinctly charged with fluviatile sand, and corals within it frequently are partly dissolved, with finer septal and dissepiment structures having disappeared. The boundary with reef 2-main is indistinct below about 25 m. The top of reef 2-main is capped by cobble pavement, which in turn is covered by shallow-water reef of small corals (reef 2-upper). The inner margin of the gravel bed crops out on terrace 2 (61 m above LWL), and the bed dips gently seaward.

The modern reef grows out from erosional groove and spur morphology in the wave-cut shore platform at cliff bases. Bayhead beaches of coarse gravels and boulders, fed by seasonal streams, occur within Berau and Nameta inlets, passing back into narrow valley plains. Modern corals are less dense within the bays than near the headlands and rarely grow up to low-water level (LWL) in any locality. The lateral transition from coral meadows to gravel floor within the bays is sharp to a depth of about 6 m and is more diffuse beyond that. Gravel bayhead beaches typically have a steep intertidal face (as much as 2.5 m above LWL), with storm-wave cusps and occasional backbeach low drifts of sand.

The sands are characterized by approximately parallel bedding which dips seawards at low angles. This may represent swash cross-stratification typical of the swash zone of the foreshore. The presence of occasional gravels within the sands is also characteristic of deposits from this environment. The marginal marine origin of these units is supported by their very well-sorted particle-size distribution.

The lower elevation sites (77A, 77D, 74, 76A) show a regressive sequence and is found at elevations between 0 and 11 m. The sequence has four units, from lowest to highest: Unit 1 - gravelly sand with occasional sand lenses, interpreted as upper shoreface.

Unit 3 - dark grey clayey silt with organic material interpreted as back-barrier sediments. Unit 4 - alternating layers of bedded sand and cross-bedded sand interpreted as delta deposits in a marine environment. Analysis of foraminifera in units 1-3 revealed species that were similar to present. Mollusc species included arctic and sub-arctic species, indicating that the environment was likely warmer than present.



The higher elevation sites (113, 97, 96, 95) were labeled as Unit A0 and found between 44 and 70 m. Unit Ao is a fine grained to gravelly sand alternating between massive and cross-bedded. The cross-beds were interpreted as being deposited by tidal currents, while the massive beds were interpreted as storm deposits. This was interpreted as being deposited in the foreshore of an exposed coast. Mollusc species were dominated by shallow water species, especially Astarte borealis. The fauna found in this unit are subarctic species, and suggest water conditions that were 2-3C warmer than the Holocene.

At -16 m, just below a minor channel scour associated to regressive phase [Rutten (regression entry)], reed rootlets/rhizomes indicate a position near the intertidal top of the estuarine mudflat. The thickness of tidal mud and basal peat below (-16 to -22.8) is 6.8 meters. Post-depositional compaction of the basal organic parts of this interval (1.3 m) is estimated a factor 2-3, mostly happening during accumulation of the tidal mud, and compaction of the tidal mud (5.5) to amount a factor 1.5-2.5, with 66% before (syn-depositional) and 33% following (post-depositional; 3.74 m +/- 0.94) the establishment of reed-vegetated mildly brackish intertidal facies, some 1.5 +/- 0.5 meter above the indicator rootlet level.

This is in agreement with the minor channel scour found on top: its infill thickness suggest that it had its shoulders around -14 m (core depth; -12.50 decompacted depth), matching the projected intertidal-supratidal transition zone, where the inner-estuarine reed marsh (or some other fluvial-tidal upper estuarine vegetation zone; such details lost to erosion) would have established.

The diatom report is in Dutch but reports that 44-37.40m is a freshwater lake with warves, no diatoms in 37.40-29 and then 29-25.5 was deposited in a marine littoral env. 

POLLEN:(also in Beets et al. 2005: Fig. 4)
5.15 - 12.00 m E4a (Corylus, Quercus, Alnus; stray grains of Taxus) - littoral.
12.00 - 26.70 m E3b (Quercus, Corylus, Alnus) - littoral
26.70 - 31.00 m E3a (Quercus, Alnus) <- 29.00 first marine diatoms

35.50 - 43.40 m E2a (Pinus, Ulmus); with reworked E1 - varved
43.40 - 43.52 m E1 (Betula, Pinus) - varved 

It means that transgression occurs in E3a (relative early on). Seismics and borehole-based mapping of the surrounding should be used to establish a sill elevation along the rim of the offshore palaeo lake, presumably to the NE (analogues to transgression of the Oyster Bank sector in the Holocene), alternatively to the W. The marine-connection contact depth at the coring location, given a water depth of 40 m+- 1 (expressed versus mean sea level, not lowest astronomical tide)  is 69 +/- 1 m.  With 15 meters of fresh lacustrine clays below, some compaction correction of 6 +/- 3 meters can be assumed. At that position, the indicator is a lower limiting (marine limiting) data point of reasonable quality.  A further elevation difference between lake water level and sill saddle height is then to be included to get to a RSL elevation estimate ( 5 +/- 3 meters --first-guess-- record can be updated further ), of lower quality than the lower limiting entry.

The facies change is announced by gradual coarsening of the clays (second part of PAZ E5). At site Amsterdam Terminal, a channel (X-bedded sandy facies) is present, that contains reworked clasts of tidal flat levels from PAZ E6 (palynology of the mud clasts - De Gans et al. (2000:157); Van Leeuwen et al. (2000: 172 & Fig. 8). The channel sand also produced a U/Th date on a mollusc shell (species:  Venerupis aurea senescens; U/Th dating result: 118.2 +/- 6.3 ka at 29.86 m core depth. 
Van Leeuwen et al. (2000) and De Gans et al., (2000) considered this a tidal channel, contemporary to the surrounding mudflats. The alternative interpretation is that it is a fluvial channel of Early Weichselian (MIS 5c-5b-5a) stratigraphic age. Mud-drapes within foresets (diagnostic for subtidal channels, in association with reactivation surfaces) are absent in the X-bedded sands. Peeters et al. (2016) obtained luminescence dates (e.g. NCL-3208139: 102 +/- 32 ka at 32.96 m core depth; NCL-3208140: 90 +/- 22 at 33.50 m core depth). They reinterpreted the channel facies as Early Weichselian fluvial (reworking into late Eemian tidal, rather than being part of it). Still, the depth at which the only locally displaced mollusc was sampled (amidst equally reworked clay clasts) serves as the Marine Limiting indicator Marine PAZ-E6 associated marine indicator serves as a marine limiting data point.

Some amount of compaction of underlying 33 meters (!) of Eemian-age lagoon clays (PAZ E4b + PAZ E5 high stand) may also be accounted for (and a more minor amount of residual compaction of the freshwater lake and late Saalian warved intervals below, but those would have already be consolidated during the 6000-7000 years of Eemian highstand inundation and sediment accumulation).

It is unclear if the 'peat lense' yielding the E3 spectrum is in-situ or a reworked clast. It may be that the site already drowned during PAZ E3 chronozone. It is certain that it had drowned by the time of PAZ E4a chronozone.

Uncertainty in the inner edge elevation was estimated from uncertainty in DGPS points, scatter of DGPS points about the estimated wave-cut platform, and differences between DGPS and LiDAR or DEM elevations.

The unconformity is sharp and planar with a small angular discordance. The erosion surface dips 3 degree to the WSW and is traced several hundred metres westwards before dipping below present sea level. To the east it gradually rises to 8 m above the high water mark immediately west of the mouth of Waingogoro River, where truncated by fluvial deposits. 
The overlying marine deposits are identified as the Inaha Formation, defined as dominantly andesitic sands and gravels presumed to extend 3-4 km inland to the Inaha Marine Cliff, which marks the shoreline at formation. The Inaha Formation sediments indicate near-shore marine and beach origin and are overlain by additional terrestrial deposits. Overlying the unconformity is a 0.3 m thick gravel unit comprising rounded and subrounded boulders, up to 0.74 m diameter, in a pebble and cobble matrix. The gravels are 90% hard hornblende-augite andesites and 10% much softer sandstones eroded from the Pliocene strata beneath. These sandstones are extensively bored by worms and molluscs and contain fossils of the date mussel Lithophaga (Zelithophaga) truncata (Gray). Above the basal gravel unit is 1.87 m of soft, weakly cross-laminated, predominantly andesitic sand with minor granules, pebbles, and cobbles that fine upwards and are extremely weathered and iron stained at top.

In the described section, the marine sediment (0.9 m thick) underlies a modern soil (0.15 m thick) and is described as a well-sorted, dark grey, ilmenite-rich sand grading into an underlying peat band (0.9 m thick). The ilmenite-rich sand is typical of beach and near-shore sand found along the coast to the north. The well-sorted nature of the sediment and rounding of softer grains suggests the sand accumulated on a beach or in the surf zone. Locally the sand and peat are separated by a thin band of grey clay. Beneath the peat is a fluvial gravel to the base of the exposure. The peat is interpreted to represent a period of swampy deposition immediately before the sea overtopped the existing gravel terrace.

The Knights Point Terrace comprises a subhorizontal sedimentary sequence up to 11 m thick, interpreted as a deposit within a dynamic and rapidly fluctuating coast, resting unconformably on Cretaceous Arnott Basalt or Whakapohai Sandstone. Sediments range from a high-energy environment boulder bed at the base to calmer environment medium sands at the top in an overall upward-fining transgressive sequence. The uppermost surface of the marine coverbeds is interpreted as the maximum flooding surface, representing either the sea-level highstand, or when sea-level rise, relative to uplift, ceased. The inferred high-energy environment is compatible with deposition within the breaker or swash zone of a coastal beach where turbulence is at a maximum. Episodic high energy events (Facies 3, 6) are assumed to be storm waves. The bouldery lag at the base of Facies 1 is interpreted as indicating proximity of bounding sea cliffs. Stratigraphic sections indicate shore platform at 105.5 to 104.2 m.
The only altitude given was the top of the succession (and Facies 7), which marks the maximum flooding surface, at 113 m. Facies 7 (variable thickness of at least 2.0 m) fines upward from a coarse sand into a fine to medium sand and is interpreted as a gradual change from a high to a moderate energy environment.

The highest feature attributed to the Eemian exists at roughly 140 m, which in some places is a broad gravel beach terrace, and elsewhere a 2-10 m escarpment with a veneer of cobbles. This feature is laterally continuous and visible on satellite imagery, and is likely buried in places underneath the Vavilov Ice Cap.  The 140 m shoreline is not directly dated, but is similar in morphology to dated shorelines at 118-125 m and is considered to have formed at roughly the same time. Underlying the marine units is glacial till correlated to the MIS 6 (Saalian) glaciation, and is overlain by glacial till that was deposited sometime between MIS 5d and MIS 4.
