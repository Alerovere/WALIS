8,Differential GPS,"GPS positions acquired in the field and corrected either in real time or during post-processing with respect to the known position of a base station or a geostationary satellite system (e.g. Omnistar). Accuracy depends on satellite signal strength, distance from base station, and number of static positions acquired at the same location.","±0.02/±0.08 m, depending on survey conditions and instruments used (e.g., single-band vs dual-band receivers)",Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-04-19 14:10:31
10,Metered tape or rod,"The end of a tape or rod is placed at a known elevation point, and the elevation of the unknown point is calculated using the metered scale and, if necessary, clinometers to calculate angles. ",Up to ±10% of elevation measurement,Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-04-19 14:11:35
7,Not reported,"The elevation measurement technique was not reported, most probably hand level or metered tape.",20% of the original elevation reported added in root mean square to the sea level datum error,Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-01-31 11:06:03
