Res.])","The Hato (Upper) unit of the ""Lower Terrace"" Curazao","The Lower Terrace is composed of two reef units, Hato (upper) and Cortalein (lower). The contact between these two units is often seen in a topographic break in coastal exposures, where a ledge in the Cortalein unit is apparent. Thus, from a geomorphic point of view, the interglacial coral reef record on Curaçao differs from those in other areas, both uplifting coasts and tectonically

stable coasts. Curaçao represents a hybrid of these two types of coasts, with a marine terrace staircase-like geomorphology

being present, similar to Barbados and Haiti. Within the Lower Terrace, however, the reef stratigraphic record more closely resembles the stacked limestone sequences found in the Florida Keys and Cayman Islands. At exposures near the seaward side of the Lower Terrace, is observed both the Hato and Cortalein units are characterized by an Acropora palmata-dominated reef-crest facies, with corals in growth position.
