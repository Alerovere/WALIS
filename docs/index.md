# <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> What is WALIS?
WALIS stands for "World Atlas of Last Interglacial Shorelines". It is a database effort aiming to collect existing and new data on Last Interglacial sea-level indicators reviewed following a standardized template, that can be filled using an online interface. WALIS is part of the [WARMCOASTS project](www.warmcoasts.eu), funded by the European Research Council. WALIS is compiled in collaboration with PALSEA (a PAGES-INQUA working group).

# <i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i> How does it work?
1. **Contribute data**. Geoscientists wishing to contribute data should register to our database interface and insert their data directly online. Data remain private and are accessible only by the registered user, until they are ready for publication. Registration to the system is (and will always be) free.
2. **Data publication**. WALIS aims to make Last Interglacial sea level data open-access and readily available. Data creators are encouraged, once their work is finalized, to submit their data to a repository under a CC BY license, and give it a DOI. We suggest submitting to Zenodo, where we set up a "Community" where data can be uploaded. Users are free to decide to submit to another open-access repository and let us know writing to alessio.rovere@unive.it
3. **Download data**. Once the data inserted by a data creator has been assigned a DOI from an open-access repository, it can be downloaded and re-used freely (complying with the simple rules at the bottom of this page). 
4. **Periodical database collations**. Periodically, WALIS data will be collated into a single release, containing all the data that were assigned a DOI up to the release date. The release will contain WALIS data in different formats, as well as scripts to query the database. The first release is planned to coincide with the closing of an ongoing Special Issue in the journal Earth System Science Data. 

##  <i class="fa-solid fa-cloud-arrow-down"></i> Download data
The data in WALIS is organized in a Zenodo Community. A series of manuscripts in a Special Issue of the journal Earth System Science Data  describes each region included in the database. The latest version of the global database, that collates all regional contributions, is also included in the GitHub repository linked on this page.

Anyone can create an account and work with our interface. It is free and only requires registration. If you already have the data standardized in WALIS format and want to submit them to Zenodo, the link below resolves directly to the data submission page for our community.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> Get help
We know that, for less expert users, the large quantity of fields in WALIS might appear intimidating. For this reason, we prepared a ReadTheDocs page and a series of YouTube tutorials to facilitate data insertion and help the user to better understand the database structure. Both are a continuous work in progress, so please feel free to contact alessio.rovere@unive.it for questions, bug reports and requests. The ReadTheDocs files are also hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/Alerovere/WALIS_Help) and the latest version is stored in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3961543).

## Other WALIS resources
We maintain a repository with the scripts for a [visualization interface](https://github.com/Alerovere/WALIS_Visualization) for WALIS data, coded in R. Field descriptors for the WALIS database are available in a [ReadTheDocs](https://walis-help.readthedocs.io) webpage.
These are also deposited in Zenodo:

### Suggested acknowledgments
WALIS is the result of the work of several people, within different projects. For this reason, we kindly ask you to follow these simple rules to properly acknowledge those who worked on it:

1. Cite the original authors - Please maintain the original citations for each datapoint, to give proper credit to those who worked to collect the original data in the field or in the lab.
2. Acknowledge the database contributor - The name of each contributor is listed in all public datapoints. This is the data creator, who spent time to make sure the data is standardized and (as much as possible) free of errors.
3. Acknowledge the database structure and interface creators - The database template used in this study was developed by the ERC Starting Grant "WARMCOASTS" (ERC-StG-802414) and is a community effort under the PALSEA (PAGES / INQUA) working group.

Example of acknowledgments: The data used in this study were *extracted from / compiled in* WALIS, a sea-level database interface developed by the ERC Starting Grant "WARMCOASTS" (ERC-StG-802414), in collaboration with PALSEA (PAGES / INQUA) working group. The database structure was designed by A. Rovere, D. Ryan, T. Lorscheid, A. Dutton, P. Chutcharavan, D. Brill, N. Jankowski, D. Mueller, M. Bartz, E. Gowan and K. Cohen. The data points used in this study were contributed to WALIS by *list names of contributors here*.

### Funding
This software is part of a project that has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. ERC-StG-802414)
