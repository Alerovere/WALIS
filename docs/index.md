# <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> What is WALIS?
WALIS stands for "World Atlas of Last Interglacial Shorelines". It is a database collecting data on Last Interglacial (70-125 ka) sea-level proxies. Each data point in WALIS follows a standard template that can be filled from an online interface. WALIS is part of the [WARMCOASTS project](www.warmcoasts.eu), funded by the European Research Council, and falls under the purview of the [PALSEA](https://palseagroup.weebly.com) working group (supported by [PAGES](https://pastglobalchanges.org) and [INQUA](https://www.inqua.org)).

# <i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i> How does it work?
1. **Contribute data**. Geoscientists wishing to contribute data should register to our database interface and insert their data directly online. Data remain private and are accessible only by the registered user until they are ready for publication. Registration to the system is (and will always be) free.
2. **Data publication**. WALIS aims to make Last Interglacial sea-level data open-access and readily available. Once their work is finalized, data creators are encouraged to submit their data to a repository under a CC BY license and give it a DOI. We suggest submitting to Zenodo, where we set up a "Community" where anyone can upload data. Users are free to decide to submit to another open-access repository and let us know by writing to [alessio.rovere@unive.it](mailto:alessio.rovere@unive.it).
3. **Download data**. Once the data inserted by a data creator has been assigned a DOI from an open-access repository, it can be downloaded and re-used freely (complying with the simple rules at the bottom of this page). 
4. **Periodical database collations**. Periodically, WALIS data will be collated into a single release, containing all the data assigned a DOI up to the release date. The first release is planned to coincide with the closing of an ongoing Special Issue in the journal [Earth System Science Data](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/special_issue1055.html). 

##  <i class="fa-solid fa-cloud-arrow-down"></i> Download data
The data in WALIS is organized in a Zenodo Community. A series of manuscripts in a Special Issue of the journal Earth System Science Data describes each region included in the database. The latest version of the global database is also included in the GitHub repository linked at this page and archived in Zenodo.

Anyone can create an account and work with our interface. It is free and only requires registration. If you already have the data standardized in WALIS format and want to submit them to Zenodo, the link below resolves directly to the data submission page for our community.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> Help
We know that, for less experienced users, the large number of fields in WALIS might appear intimidating. For this reason, we prepared a ReadTheDocs page and a series of YouTube tutorials to facilitate data insertion and help the user to understand the database structure better. Both are a continuous work in progress, so don't hesitate to get in touch with [alessio.rovere@unive.it](mailto:alessio.rovere@unive.it) for questions, bug reports, and requests. The ReadTheDocs files are also hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/Alerovere/WALIS_Help), and the latest docs version is stored in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3961543).

## <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Visualize and query WALIS
A summary with the main WALIS data can be visualized and queried via a ShinyApp coded in R. The R code is available in [Github](https://github.com/Alerovere/WALIS_Visualization/tree/v1.0) and [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4943540).

# <i class="fa-regular fa-sack-dollar"></i> Suggested acknowledgments and funding
WALIS is the result of the work of several people, within different projects. For this reason, we kindly ask you to follow these simple rules to properly acknowledge those who worked on it:

1. Cite the original authors - Please maintain the original citations for each datapoint, to give proper credit to those who worked to collect the original data in the field or in the lab.
2. Acknowledge the database contributor - The name of each contributor is listed in all public datapoints. This is the data creator, who spent time to make sure the data is standardized and (as much as possible) free of errors.
3. Acknowledge the database structure and interface creators - The database template used in this study was developed by the ERC Starting Grant "WARMCOASTS" (ERC-StG-802414) and is a community effort under the PALSEA (PAGES / INQUA) working group.

### Example of acknowledgments
The data used in this study were *extracted from / compiled in* WALIS, a sea-level database interface developed by the ERC Starting Grant "WARMCOASTS" (ERC-StG-802414), in collaboration with PALSEA (PAGES / INQUA) working group. The database structure was designed by A. Rovere, D. Ryan, T. Lorscheid, A. Dutton, P. Chutcharavan, D. Brill, N. Jankowski, D. Mueller, M. Bartz, E. Gowan and K. Cohen. The data points used in this study were contributed to WALIS by *list names of contributors here*.

### Funding
This software is part of a project that has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. ERC-StG-802414)
