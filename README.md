### Suggested acknowledgments
WALIS is the result of the work of several people, within different projects. For this reason, we kindly ask you to follow these simple rules to properly acknowledge those who worked on it:

1. Cite the original authors - Please maintain the original citations for each datapoint, to give proper credit to those who worked to collect the original data in the field or in the lab.
2. Acknowledge the database contributor - The name of each contributor is listed in all public datapoints. This is the data creator, who spent time to make sure the data is standardized and (as much as possible) free of errors.
3. Acknowledge the database structure and interface creators - The database template used in this study was developed by the ERC Starting Grant “WARMCOASTS” (ERC-StG-802414) and is a community effort under the PALSEA (PAGES / INQUA) working group.

Example of acknowledgments: The data used in this study were extracted from / compiled in WALIS, a sea-level database interface developed by the ERC Starting Grant “WARMCOASTS” (ERC-StG-802414), in collaboration with PALSEA (PAGES / INQUA) working group. The database structure was designed by A. Rovere, D. Ryan, T. Lorscheid, A. Dutton, P. Chutcharavan, D. Brill, N. Jankowski, D. Mueller, M. Bartz, E. Gowan and K. Cohen. The data points used in this study were contributed to WALIS by list names of contributors here.
