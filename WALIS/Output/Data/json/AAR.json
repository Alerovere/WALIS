An initial D\/L ratio of 0.01 was assumed for all calculations and is based on analysis of yong radiocarbon-dated samples. A value of 0.86 for the equilibrium constant for isoleucine epimerization in wood was determined by Lee et al (1976) and was used in this study. Substitution of these values in the integrated rate equation for AAR (see Bada and Schroeder, 1972) yields an in situ forward rate constant KL = 2.59 x 10-7 yr-1 [see publication for super- and sub-script], wich was then used to calculate ages for all other samples. This calculation assumes that all samples have had similar diagenetic histories (particularly temperature) and that no contamination is present. Because all samples were deeply buried and lie within a climatically and geologically uniform region and because the dates are stratigraphically consistent, these assumptions appear reasonable.

An initial D\/L ratio of 0.01 was assumed for all calculations and is based on analysis of yong radiocarbon-dated samples. A value of 0.86 for the equilibrium constant for isoleucine epimerization in wood was determined by Lee et al (1976) and was used in this study. Substitution of these values in the integrated rate equation for AAR (see Bada and Schroeder, 1972) yields an in situ forward rate constant KL = 2.59 x 10-7 yr-1 [see publication for super- and sub-script], wich was then used to calculate ages for all other samples. This calculation assumes that all samples have had similar diagenetic histories (particularly temperature) and that no contamination is present. Because all samples were deeply buried and lie within a climatically and geologically uniform region and because the dates are stratigraphically consistent, these assumptions appear reasonable. No attempt was made to restrict analyses to a single tree species.\n\nAAR Calibration samples: BJP-029, BJP-028, BJP-027, BJP-026", "Amino Acid age equation": "integrated rate equation", "Calibration laboratory": "", "Calibration laboratory ID": "", "Calibration reference": "1084", "Calibration D\/L value": "0.112", "Calibration D\/L value uncertainty (±1σ)": "", "Calibration age (ka)": "370.00", "Calibration age (ka) uncertainty (±1σ)": "50.000", "Independent age choice": "", "Independent age method": "", "Independent age laboratory": "", "Independent age laboratory ID": "", "Independent age result": "", "Independent age reference": "", "U-Series age constraint": "", "ESR age constraint": "", "Luminescence age constraint": "", "Stratigraphic age constraint": "", "Record created by": "Deirdre Ryan", "Record updated by": "Deirdre Ryan", "Last Update": "2020-06-12 17:41:48" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 174.304671, -39.60073 ] } }
