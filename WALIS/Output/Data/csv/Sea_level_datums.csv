19,Australian Height Datum (AHD),"Definition from Geoscience Australia: ""In 1971 the mean sea level for 1966–1968 was assigned the value of 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum at thirty tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent. The resulting datum surface, with minor modifications in two metropolitan areas, has been termed the Australian Height Datum (AHD) and was adopted by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping (and other surveying functions) is to be referred.""",N/A,,Alessio Rovere,,2020-04-07 14:46:09
3,High Tide Level,"Described by Kennedy et al (2007) as the swash limit and the extent of fixed biological indicators, such as molluscs, having a restricted vertical range.","Per Rees-Jones et al (2000), accurate to +/- 2m up to 15 m a.h.s.l and +/-5-10m above 15m a.h.s.l.
Uncertainty will be dependent upon measurement method.","Kennedy et al., 2007
