2,1,Rotoehu Tephra,"238 U / 230 Th disequilibrium dating
(U-Th) / He zircon dating
40 Ar / 39 Ar K-feldspar and biotite crystals","Used widely in the North Island of New Zealand to constrain the age of marine terraces. The tephra has been subject to various direct and indirect chronological techniques, including isotopic, radiometric, radiation exposure, and stratigraphic approaches. Results of dating methods applied since 2012 are summarized here. Publications before this date may have associated a different age to the tephra.",50.0,45.0,Equal to,MIS 3,MIS 3,"Danišík et al 2012

3,1,MIS 5 Terrace Correlation,"Correlation based upon physical characteristics including, but not limited to: sediments, pollen, altitude above modern sea level, and position within a terrace sequence. With regards to the latter, terrace age can be further refined to substages within MIS 5; i.e. MIS 5e, 5c, 5a.",Age determination by correlating terrace to either near-by or distant terraces (not necessarily the same country or continent) or the marine oxygen isotope stage.,,,Equal to,MIS 5,MIS 5,"Ryan et al., 2020",Deirdre Ryan,Deirdre Ryan,2020-01-15 11:06:24

Age determined from both 10Be and 26Al; however only 10Be ages provided for all samples. The 10Be and 26Al ages overlapped (with error) in 3 of 4 instances. Of the six samples, there was one outlier - this includes a 26Al result.

163,1,Anadara trapezia,Indicator species,"Extensive distribution and abundance throughout Australia during MIS 5e has been severely constricted during the Holocene allowing for the species to be considered an indicator species of MIS 5e around much (but not all) of the continent. There is limited presence of the species during MIS 7.
Although present in the NZ fossil record for MIS 11, 9, 7, and 5e, the species has since become extinct in NZ. It is not considered an indicator species for MIS 5e within NZ, but for Middle to Late Pleistocene interglacials.
