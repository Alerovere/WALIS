11,Beach deposit or beachrock,"Definition by Mauz et al., 2015: ""Beachrocks are lithified coastal deposits that are organized in sequences of slabs with seaward inclination generally between 5° and 15°"". Definition of indicative meaning from Rovere et al., 2016.",(Ordinary berm + breaking depth) / 2,Ordinary berm - breaking depth,"Mauz et al., 2015

14,Shore platform,"Kennedy, 2015 defines shore platforms as ""sub-horizontal rocky surfaces that interrupt vertical cliffs at or near sea-level"".  Definition of indicative meaning adapted by Rovere et al., 2016 from Kennedy, 2015.",[Mean Higher High Water + (Breaking depth-MLLW)/2]/2,Mean Higher High Water - (Breaking depth-MLLW)/2,"Kennedy, 2015

15,Lagoonal deposit,"Lagoonal deposits consist of silty and/or clayey sediments, horizontally laminated (Zecchin et al., 2004) and associated with fossils of brackish or marine water fauna. Definition of indicative meaning from Rovere et al., 2016.",(MLLW + modern Lagoon depth)/2,MLLW to modern Lagoon depth,"Rovere et al., 2016

24,Estuary deposit,"""An estuary is a semi-enclosed costal body of water that extends to the effective limit of tidal influence, within which sea water entering from one or more free connections with the open sea, or any other saline coastal body of water, is significantly diluted with fresh water derived from land drainage, and can sustain euryhaline biological species from either part or the whole of their life cycle."" - Definition from Perillo, 1995",< highest astronomical tide (HAT),"The upper limit of estuary deposits is the highest astronomical tide, but the lower limit is bounded bathymetry. As a result, an estuary deposit can only be used as a marine limiting indicator, with an uncertainty range that is HAT-MSL.",Perillo 1995,Evan Gowan,Evan Gowan,2020-01-31
29,Beach swash deposit,part of the beach face located between mean sea level and foredune,"(Upper limit + Lower limit) / 2
Upper limit = spring tidal range / 2 or MHHW
Lower limit = MSL","(Upper limit - Lower limit)
Upper limit = spring tidal range / 2 or MHHW
Lower limit = MSL",,Deirdre Ryan,WALIS Admin,2021-01-05
