The unconformity is sharp and planar with a small angular discordance. The erosion surface dips 3 degree to the WSW and is traced several hundred metres westwards before dipping below present sea level. To the east it gradually rises to 8 m above the high water mark immediately west of the mouth of Waingogoro River, where truncated by fluvial deposits. 
The overlying marine deposits are identified as the Inaha Formation, defined as dominantly andesitic sands and gravels presumed to extend 3-4 km inland to the Inaha Marine Cliff, which marks the shoreline at formation. The Inaha Formation sediments indicate near-shore marine and beach origin and are overlain by additional terrestrial deposits. Overlying the unconformity is a 0.3 m thick gravel unit comprising rounded and subrounded boulders, up to 0.74 m diameter, in a pebble and cobble matrix. The gravels are 90% hard hornblende-augite andesites and 10% much softer sandstones eroded from the Pliocene strata beneath. These sandstones are extensively bored by worms and molluscs and contain fossils of the date mussel Lithophaga (Zelithophaga) truncata (Gray). Above the basal gravel unit is 1.87 m of soft, weakly cross-laminated, predominantly andesitic sand with minor granules, pebbles, and cobbles that fine upwards and are extremely weathered and iron stained at top.

It is backed by an old cliff-line. The marine sediments and dune sands are known collectively as the Otaki Formation, with the dune sands referred to as the Otaki Sandstone.

The Knights Point Terrace comprises a subhorizontal sedimentary sequence up to 11 m thick, interpreted as a deposit within a dynamic and rapidly fluctuating coast, resting unconformably on Cretaceous Arnott Basalt or Whakapohai Sandstone. Sediments range from a high-energy environment boulder bed at the base to calmer environment medium sands at the top in an overall upward-fining transgressive sequence. The uppermost surface of the marine coverbeds is interpreted as the maximum flooding surface, representing either the sea-level highstand, or when sea-level rise, relative to uplift, ceased. The inferred high-energy environment is compatible with deposition within the breaker or swash zone of a coastal beach where turbulence is at a maximum. Episodic high energy events (Facies 3, 6) are assumed to be storm waves. The bouldery lag at the base of Facies 1 is interpreted as indicating proximity of bounding sea cliffs.
