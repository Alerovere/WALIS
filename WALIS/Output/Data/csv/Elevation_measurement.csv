12,Barometric altimeter,Difference in barometric pressure between a point of known elevation (often sea level) and a point of unknown elevation. Not accurate and used only rarely in sea-level studies,Up to ±20% of elevation measurement,Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-04-19 14:13:11
8,Differential GPS,"GPS positions acquired in the field and corrected either in real time or during post-processing with respect to the known position of a base station or a geostationary satellite system (e.g. Omnistar). Accuracy depends on satellite signal strength, distance from base station, and number of static positions acquired at the same location.","±0.02/±0.08 m, depending on survey conditions and instruments used (e.g., single-band vs dual-band receivers)",Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-04-19 14:10:31
25,Dumpy level ,"Elevation is determined from a benchmark point having a defined height above sea-level datum (typically mean sea level). The level head with telescope (placed upon a tripod) is used in conjunction with a 5m staff to measure change in elevation from backsight (starting at benchmark) to foresight (towards desired elevation measurement). 

Ideally, only one backsight and foresight measurement is needed; however, if distance between backsight/foresight is great or the slope change is excessive, multiple readings will be needed adding to measurement uncertainty.

10,Metered tape or rod,"The end of a tape or rod is placed at a known elevation point, and the elevation of the unknown point is calculated using the metered scale and, if necessary, clinometers to calculate angles. ",Up to ±10% of elevation measurement,Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-04-19 14:11:35
7,Not reported,"The elevation measurement technique was not reported, most probably hand level or metered tape.",20% of the original elevation reported added in root mean square to the sea level datum error,Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-01-31 11:06:03
13,Photogrammetric methods or aneroid altimeter,Short transverse from fixed heights such as trigonometric stations or sea level,uncertainty is approximately + / - 5 m,Deirdre Ryan,WALIS Admin,2020-05-21 07:22:53
11,Topographic map and digital elevation models,"Elevation derived from the contour lines on topographic maps. Most often used for large-scale landforms (i.e. marine terraces). Several meters of error are possible, depending on the scale of the map or the resolution of the DEM",Variable with scale ofmap and technique used to derive DEM.,Alessio Rovere,,2019-04-04 04:51:12
9,Total station or Auto/hand level,"Total stations or levels measure slope distances from the instrument to a particular point and triangulate relative to the XYZ coordinates of the base station. The accuracy of this process depends on how well defined the reference point and on the distance of the surveyed point from the base station. Thus, it is necessary to benchmark the reference station with a nearby tidal datum, or use a precisely (DGPS) known geodetic point. The accuracy of the elevation measurement is also inversely proportional to the distance between the instrument and the point being measured.","±0.1/±0.2m for total station
±0.2/±0.4 m for hand level",Alessio Rovere,,2019-04-04 04:49:38
