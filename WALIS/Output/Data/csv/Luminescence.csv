Dose rates were determined from radionuclide content, water content, and a-value and from the expected dose rate from cosmic rays. Radionuclide contents were measured in the laboratory using gamma spectrometry. Gamma rays were counted for a minimum of 24 hrs, using a high-resolution, broad-energy gamma spectrometer. Spectra were analyzed with GENIE2000 software. U, Th, and K concentrations were determined by comparison to standard samples. The dose rate from radionuclides were calculated using the conversion factors of Guerin et al (2011).  The a-value was estimated at 0.05 +/- 0.01 for all samples. The dose rate from cosmic rays was calculated from burial depth, geomagnetic latitude, and altitude, using the formulas and correction factors of Prescott and Hutton (1994).

Three different ages were calculated for this sample due to the disequilibrium in the uranium decay chain.
