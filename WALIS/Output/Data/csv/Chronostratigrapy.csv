 Ryan et al., 2020","Biozone P6 (1 of 9 biozones identified) is a unit consisting of marine shelly gravel; shelly sand with occasional sand, mud, and gravel horizons with marine shell deposited in a nearshore marine or estuarine environment. Palynology indicates a warm, moist, humid environment, likely warmer and wetter than present. 

P6 is bounded by sediments deposited in cooler periglacial (below) glacial (above) environments.

Begg et al (2004) in their summary of their earlier work (Begg et al 2002 - not made available in this review) referred to radiocarbon ages of shell from marginal marine deposits below the surface to assist in constraining age of deposits in the Lower Hutt Valley. They refer to Biozone P6 as the Wilford Shellbed and correlate it to an oxygen isotope sea level curve (Martinson et al., 1987), with MIS 5 between 128 to 71 ka.

""The juxtaposition of this sand between a coarse silty sand below and a fine silty clay above allows for this unit to either represent a continued shallowing form Unit I or more probably, a new transgressive deposit under the fine aqueous deposits of Unit K. This unit was beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating and the TL age of 154 +/- 21 ka is both older and less well resolved than the ages above and below it. The sediments of Unit J may be the products of a storm event, or even a tsunami, and if so the light-sensitive TL could have been incompletely zeroed.
