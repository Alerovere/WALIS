10,GIS georeferenced version of original map,"The original publication contains a map figure at detailed scale (< 1:25,000). The figure is scanned or screengrabbed. The map has been CAREFULLY georeferenced in GIS: Using RMS errors of georeferencing control points, one should confirm if the typical accuracy reported below is reproduced). The GIS is used to convert between original projection and coordinates, to WGS84 lat/long values at spot locations.","Scale 1:5000: 1 m.  Scale 1:25,000:  10 m",Kim Cohen,,2020-03-27 05:59:36
