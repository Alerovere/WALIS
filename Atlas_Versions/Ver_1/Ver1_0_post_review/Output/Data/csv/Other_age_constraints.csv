42,1,strontium isotopes,87Sr/86Sr,"Sr isotope ratios were measured at two laboratories, the University of Cambridge
and the University of the Ryukyus, using a VG Sector 54 and a Finnigan Mat 262
mass spectrometer. The 88Sr beam was controlled at ca. 3 V during which 12 blocks
of 10 ratios were measured. Each sample was analysed one to three times. The
Rb content was low enough (less than 0.1 ppm) that no correction for in-growth of
radiogenic 87Sr was necessary. A 85Rb beam was monitored for within run correction.
Typical corrections of 0.000 005 were required to the measured 87Sr/86Sr ratios. Mass fractionation was corrected using an exponential fractionation law. The NBS SRM
987 standard measured during the course of this study gave 87Sr/86Sr = 0.710 251
(±9, 2SD) (n = 42) at Cambridge and 87Sr/86Sr = 0.710 246 (±9, 2SD) (n = 25)
