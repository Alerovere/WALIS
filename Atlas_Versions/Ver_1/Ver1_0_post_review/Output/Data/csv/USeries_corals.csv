The contact between these two units is often seen in a topographic break in coastal exposures, where a ledge in the Cortalein unit is apparent. Thus, from a geomorphic point of view, the interglacial coral reef record on Curaçao differs from those in other areas, both uplifting coasts and tectonically

stable coasts. Curaçao represents a hybrid of these two types of coasts, with a marine terrace staircase-like geomorphology

being present, similar to Barbados and Haiti.
