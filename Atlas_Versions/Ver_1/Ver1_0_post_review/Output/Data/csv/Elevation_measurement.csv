WALIS ElevMeas ID,Measurement technique,Description,Typical accuracy,Record created by,Record updated by,Last Update,General type
12,Barometric altimeter,Difference in barometric pressure between a point of known elevation (often sea level) and a point of unknown elevation. Not accurate and used only rarely in sea-level studies,Up to ±20% of elevation measurement,Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-04-19 14:13:11,Low accuracy
14,Cross-section from publication,The elevation was extracted from a published sketch/topogrpahic section.,"Variable, depending on the scale of the sketch or topographic section.",Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-04-19 14:13:26,Low accuracy
8,Differential GPS,"GPS positions acquired in the field and corrected either in real time or during post-processing with respect to the known position of a base station or a geostationary satellite system (e.g. Omnistar). Accuracy depends on satellite signal strength, distance from base station, and number of static positions acquired at the same location.","±0.02/±0.08 m, depending on survey conditions and instruments used (e.g., single-band vs dual-band receivers)",Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-04-19 14:10:31,High accuracy
16,Digital Depth Gauge,Digital depth gauge,Reported to be +/-0.1 m.  Salinity changes with depth may increase that error.,Alessio Rovere,,2020-04-20 16:01:15,High accuracy
21,Distance from top of drill core,Distance from the top of drill core.,Depending on coring technique and sampling procedures,Alessio Rovere,,2020-10-16 16:05:55,Low accuracy
25,Dumpy level ,"Elevation is determined from a benchmark point having a defined height above sea-level datum (typically mean sea level). The level head with telescope (placed upon a tripod) is used in conjunction with a 5m staff to measure change in elevation from backsight (starting at benchmark) to foresight (towards desired elevation measurement). 

Ideally, only one backsight and foresight measurement is needed; however, if distance between backsight/foresight is great or the slope change is excessive, multiple readings will be needed adding to measurement uncertainty. ",Up to 10% of the elevation measurement,Deirdre Ryan,Deirdre Ryan,2021-10-22 19:23:53,Low accuracy
23,Handheld GPS,Commercial hand-held GPS,Dependent on model and satellite coverage but could be as low as 1-2 m.,Alexander Simms,Alexander Simms,2021-06-03 17:09:47,Low accuracy

10,Metered tape or rod,"The end of a tape or rod is placed at a known elevation point, and the elevation of the unknown point is calculated using the metered scale and, if necessary, clinometers to calculate angles. ",Up to ±10% of elevation measurement,Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-04-19 14:11:35,Low accuracy
22,Multibeam bathymetry data + core depth,"Bathymetry derived from multibeam surveys in offshore areas and samples from cores obtained from the seabed (gravity, vibro, rotary drilling...)","The accuracy of modern MBES systems is currently considered of cm-scale (<0.1 m). Main errors are derived from tidal corrections and the coring system (core shortening, non-vertical drilling, compaction, sample thickness...)",Víctor Cartelle,Víctor Cartelle,2021-02-22 12:14:27,High accuracy
7,Not reported,"The elevation measurement technique was not reported, most probably hand level or metered tape.",20% of the original elevation reported added in root mean square to the sea level datum error,Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-01-31 11:06:03,N/A
13,Photogrammetric methods or aneroid altimeter,Short transverse from fixed heights such as trigonometric stations or sea level,uncertainty is approximately + / - 5 m,Deirdre Ryan,WALIS Admin,2020-05-21 07:22:53,Low accuracy
19,TerraceM,TerraceM is a graphical user interface in MATLAB that allows estimation of the shoreline angle and its associated error using high-resolution topography. The shoreline-angle elevation is measured on topographic swath profiles oriented orthogonally to the terrace riser by outlining the paleocliffs and paleoplatforms and finding their intersection by extrapolating linear regressions.,Precision and accuracy are inversely related to DEM resolution and depend on the preservation of the paleocliff and paleoplatform.,Roland Freisleben,Roland Freisleben,2020-08-11 15:42:23,Topographic map

11,Topographic map and digital elevation models,"Elevation derived from the contour lines on topographic maps. Most often used for large-scale landforms (i.e. marine terraces). Several meters of error are possible, depending on the scale of the map or the resolution of the DEM",Variable with scale ofmap and technique used to derive DEM.,Alessio Rovere,,2019-04-04 04:51:12,Topographic map
9,Total station or Auto/hand level,"Total stations or levels measure slope distances from the instrument to a particular point and triangulate relative to the XYZ coordinates of the base station. The accuracy of this process depends on how well defined the reference point and on the distance of the surveyed point from the base station. Thus, it is necessary to benchmark the reference station with a nearby tidal datum, or use a precisely (DGPS) known geodetic point. The accuracy of the elevation measurement is also inversely proportional to the distance between the instrument and the point being measured.","±0.1/±0.2m for total station
