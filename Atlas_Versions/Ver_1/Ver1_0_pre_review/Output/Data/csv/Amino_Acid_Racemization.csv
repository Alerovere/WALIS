The sample, of which about 50 mg should remain, is then weighed accurately. A solution of ""Nor-leucine"" (non-proteinic amino acid as internal standard) and 2N HCL is added to the sample. After vacuum centrifugation, for the analysis of the total hydrolysed fraction, 200 ml of 6N HCL is added; this hermetically sealed vial is then heated at 110C for 22 hours. After heating, the vial is uncorked and placed in a vacuum desiccator. 

For analysis, the sample is rehydrated and placed in the ion exchange chromatograph for 90 minutes. Amino acids are mixed with a reactive solution of O-phthalaldehde, and the formed compounds are detected by fluorescence and measured with a microphotometer.

A value of 0.86 for the equilibrium constant for isoleucine epimerization in wood was determined by Lee et al (1976) and was used in this study. Substitution of these values in the integrated rate equation for AAR (see Bada and Schroeder, 1972) yields an in situ forward rate constant KL = 2.59 x 10-7 yr-1 [see publication for super- and sub-script], wich was then used to calculate ages for all other samples. This calculation assumes that all samples have had similar diagenetic histories (particularly temperature) and that no contamination is present. Because all samples were deeply buried and lie within a climatically and geologically uniform region and because the dates are stratigraphically consistent, these assumptions appear reasonable. No attempt was made to restrict analyses to a single tree species.
