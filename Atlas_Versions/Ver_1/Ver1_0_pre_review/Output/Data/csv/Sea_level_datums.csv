19,Australian Height Datum (AHD),"Definition from Geoscience Australia: ""In 1971 the mean sea level for 1966–1968 was assigned the value of 0.000m on the Australian Height Datum at thirty tide gauges around the coast of the Australian continent. The resulting datum surface, with minor modifications in two metropolitan areas, has been termed the Australian Height Datum (AHD) and was adopted by the National Mapping Council as the datum to which all vertical control for mapping (and other surveying functions) is to be referred.""",N/A,,Alessio Rovere,,2020-04-07 14:46:09,Ordnance or geodetic datum

7,DNN (Danish ordnance datum),DNN (Dansk Normaal  Nul) is the O.D. in Denmark.

Denmark covers the GIA hinge zone between rebound (the northeast) and forebulge collapse (the southwest), and cm-scale redefinitions may have been in play between 1980ies and 2000s surveys.

8,ITALGEO90,"From the ISG website: ""ITALGEO90 is a gravimetric quasi-geoid covering the whole Italian territory. With respect to the previous ITALGEO83 estimate, the gravity database is the same but the Residual Terrain Correction (RTC) has been introduced to account for the high frequencies of the gravimetric signal. The remove-restore procedure is based on the IFE88E2 global gravity model (tailored over Europe) up to degree and order 360 and on the following two digital terrain models: the national DTM of mean heigths with 7""x10"" resolution and the global DTM TUG87 with 5'x5' resolution. The latter has been used both to complete the missing data of the former (mainly for the bathymetry) and to compute the mean reference DTM which is necessary for the RTC computation. The two DTMs are not completely consistent, showing some systematic differences. A collocation procedure has been applied for each of the 11 overlapped zones, after locally adapting some parameters of the covariance function. The precision is of the order of meter in absolute and about 5 ppm in relative.""",The precision is of the order of meter in absolute and about 5 ppm in relative.,"Benciolini et al., 1991",Alessio Rovere,Alessio Rovere,2020-04-19 14:25:33,Ordnance or geodetic datum
