17,Drowned valley floor Transgressive Contact,"A transgressive contact between terrestrial aggradational facies (below) and subaquatic aggradational facies (above). The terrestrial facies is typically a decimeter thick river flood-basin peat bed or organic mud with immature paleosol [formed shortly before the transgression], often overlying some further decimeters-metre of overbank and river channel facies showing more developed floodplain paleosol formation [late low stand paleosols, climatic amelioration before transgression]. The subaquatic facies is typically decimeter-metre thick, organic muds, rich in fine and coarse detrital organic matter [gyttjaic facies; riparian swamp and marsh vegetation macrofossils], rich in mud admixtures, bearing tidal indicators, bearing microfossil indicators of occasional brackish estuarine inwash, and grading upward into established tidal, brackish to saline, full estuarine facies [continued transgressive deepening and inland shifting of the river mouth]. See Hijma & Cohen 2011, 2019 for Holocene example (Rhine valley/estuary) and see Sier et al. 2015; Peeters et al. 2019 for Last Interglacial example (Rhine valley/estuary), where research locaties used in sedimentary reconstructions of the transgressive stages of estuaries/deltas/river mouths are worked up into sea-level indicator data points. Similar such work is available for other larger delta systems - and the indicator type is intended for inclusive use of such data sets in this database.","(HAT to MSL) / 2
Whereas the basal contact between terrestrial peat and paleosols in overbank deposits or valley rim substrate in isolation is to be considered a terrestrial limiting point marking groundwater and riverine flooding hydrological changes rather  than estuarine sea-level rise (Hijma & Cohen, 2019) , the transgressive contact at the top of such a peat bed has direct estuarine inundation meaning. See also the IR description.","HAT to MSL
In wide valleys experiencing relatively rapid postglacial transgression (>0.7 m/cy) unfilled estuaries result and tidal amplification as observed in high stand filled estuaries, is not much of a problem. HAT values at the estuary mouth / open sea may in fact be dampened inland in such estuaries (Vis et al. 2015). On the other hand, in inland parts of the estuary riverine discharge may impose a gradient and lift dampened inland tides to the same altitudes as that of HAT at the estuary mouth (Van de Plassche, 1995; Hijma & Cohen 2019).","Hijma & Cohen, 2019

18,Basal Peat (non-mangrove),"Basal Peats are terrestrial deposits encountered along the base of Transgressive-to-High Stand depositional systems (coastal plain wedges, estuarine wedges, deltaic wedges) and in submerged position on shelves (e.g. Jelgersma, 1979; Hanebuth et al., 2000). They are found underneath transgressive surfaces, buried by subaqueous deposits (tidal, brackish, estuarine, lagoonal, sea-floor ravinement surfaces). Basal peats occur across valley floors, across valley rims, across interfluve highs, across flanks of isolated topographic features within older coastal  marsh. and subaquatic aggradational facies (above). The peaty terrestrial facies is typically a few decimeters thick (in compacted state, cf. Greenfield & Tucker, 1986; Brain, 2015), and often overlies a surface with a more developed paleosol [late low stand paleosols, climatic amelioration before transgression]. See Jelgersma (1961) and Van de Plassche (1982, 1986, 1995) for Holocene examples (Netherlands) and Zagwijn (1983) for Last Interglacial examples from the same region. Using basal peats as RSL indicators became widely established in the Holocene sea-level communities since the 1970ies (Nelson, 1986), both onshore and offshore. Likewise, it is of use as an RSL indicator in interglacial coastal settings (e.g. Streif, 2004), especially when combined with palynological investigations to provide some time-control on the position within the interglacial (e.g.: Chronostratigraphy:  regional pollenzonations). 
In temperate climate conditions (i.e. Northern Hemisphere near-field latitudes in lateglacial to interglacial times), peat-forming environments establish and maintain themselves during slow and modestly fast transgressional phases. Its distribution becomes discontinuous, with overstepped zones at higher rates of RSL. The critical rate at which this happens has been assessed in the Rhine delta (Netherlands), for the Holocene and the Last Interglacial transgressional episodes (Peeters et al. 2019: section 5.1). At a coastal plain GWL-rise (forced by RSL-rise) less than 7 m/ka, the basal peat bed develops as fairly continuous, diachronic blanket across gently sloping valley and interfluve terrain (older downdip in seaward direction, younger updip in landward direction). The facies composition will be patches of swamp within more widespread marsh at higher rates, and more extensive patches of swamp at slower rates (Bos et al., 2011). During phases where RSL-rise and hence lower coastal plain GWL rise exceeds c. 7 m/ka (the domain of meltwater pulses), the blanket of diachronic basal peat no-longer is continuous (Peeters et al., 2019): it will show gaps in occurrence in depth zones that are transgressed at the higher rates (Cohen, 2005; Hijma & Cohen, 2011), and subaqueous muddy and/or detrital organic facies (gyttjaic rather than peaty) lithostratigraphically replace the basal peat bed in the overstepped zone (Bos et al., 2011; Hijma & Cohen, 2010; 2019).","GWL
The basal peat basal contact is to be considered a terrestrial limiting point (e.g. Van de Plassche, 1986; Nelson, 2015; Vis et al., 2015; Hijma & Cohen, 2019). Basal peat accommodates because of relative rise of GWL. In coastal plain situations that GWL rise may be RSL-rise controlled, especially when basal peat formation becomes widespread. Regional basal peats are better limiting points (candidate sea-level indicator points even), local basal peats are weaker limiting points: peat can form far inland, fully independent and well ahead/long before of any coastal transgressive forcing. Assessing the paleogeographical situation of the basal peat data point or swarm of data points, may help to filter these points and keep only the coastally-relevant one (Vis et al. 2015; Hijma & Cohen 2019). Undertaking such activities is advised when deciding on entries of Basal Peat type data points in this database.
","Swamp peat: (GWL to GWL-0.2m); Marsh peat (GWL-0.3 to GWL-0.8m) 
The basal peat starts to accumulate when local hydrological circumstance cause the groundwater table to rise to the surface (base basal peat), initiating swamp or marsh conditions. Further rise of the water table than explains the accumulation of organics as peats. Depending on swamp/fen/marsh type (botanic composition indicates this) the annual mean groundwater table is 0.0-0.2 meter above the peaty surface (swamps, fens) to 0.3-1.0 meter (reed marsh). Note that in a transgressive setting (rising water level tendency) at the base of the peat bed one expects IR to be close to GWL and near the top one expects the IR to be few dm below GWL.

20,Estuarine Terrace (preserved tidal flat surface),"A variant of the Marine Terrace option elsewhere in this database. Paraphrasing Pirazzoli et al., 2005: ""Any relatively flat surface of estuarine origin"". The difference with the Marine Terraces are (1) the orientation of the estuarine terrace is 'along' a falling-stage river valley / high stand embayment, and 'across' the shore line of headland coasts and barrier-coastal stretches under wave attack; (2) the flatness of the abandoned surface is not so much due to wave action and storm swash, but more due to intertidal/supratidal flooding just prior to terrace abandonment. 

The locality Petten (Zagwijn 1983) in the Rhine estuary (Peeters et al. 2015, 2016) from the begin falling stage of MIS-5d is an example of a buried Estuarine terrace. The Tagus system in Portugal bears non-buried examples (Vis et al., 2008). 

Estuarine terraced reaches in seaward direction grade to Marine terraces, with some elevation ramp effects owing to transitioning in RWL indicative meaning of the terrace surface. In landward direction, they grade to riverine terraces / former floodplains.",(HAT + MSL) / 2,Between MSL and HAT (upper intertidal),"Peeters et al., 2015
