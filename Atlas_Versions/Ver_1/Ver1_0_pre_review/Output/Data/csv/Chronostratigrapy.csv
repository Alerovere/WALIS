Its correlative sediments can be traced from north to south along the whole of the coastal plain [...]. The vertical facies succession of Barrier III testifies to its regressive stratigraphic nature [...]. The barrier is composed by sandy beach facies covered by eolian deposits. Beach facies consists of white, well sorted, quartzose fine sand, with very well developed stratification reflecting different process occurring in the various beach subenvironments. Eolian facies are composed of reddish, quartzose, and structureless fine sand with abundant root traces. Locally, the beach sands contain remarkable occurrences of the trace fossil , interpreted as sp. burrows. The level of highest concentration of burrows defines an ancient sea-level situated around 6-8 m above the present"".  Some chronologic constraints are available from Barrier III deposits from Tomazelli and Dillenburg, 2007, who report thermoluminescence ages of 85 ka (Poupeau et al., 1988) for the eaolian facies and 109+/-7.5 ka for the foreshore facies (Tomazelli et al., 2006). Based on these hints, Tomazelli et al., 2006 argue that ""Barrier III deposits, originated near the peak of the Last Intergalcial transgression, can be firmly correlated with similar sediments described in many other segments of the Brazilian coast"" such as those described by Suguio et al., (1985).

 Seidenkranz, 1993","See the main entry West Baltic Sea Cyprina Clay for a full description.
This entry matches foraminifera zone RKFO3 as described in Kristensen et al., (2000) for the Cyprina Clay. 
This entry correlates chronostratigraphically to foraminiferal zone E as described by Seidenkranz (1993) in deep waters in the south of the Kattegat palaeoembayment.
This entry correlates chronostratigraphically to intervals at the very base of the 'Lower Turritella terebra' molluscan zone of Larsen et al. (2009) in the centre of the Kattegat paleoembayment: the lower most parts of regional foraminferal zone to N3 (AV-F2).

The lower brackish parts of the Cyprina clay define the first stages of deposition of this marine unit (overlying liminic strata), starting brackish and becoming saline gradually. On marine biogeographic grounds the brackish onset of Cyprina clay sedimentation marks the establishment of a first tidal connection with the North Sea via the Kattegat of North Denmark (Kristensen et al., 2000; Funder et al., 2002), via deep (palaeo-)sounds of east central Denmark, notably the Alnarp-Esrum palaeovalley in the OreSund (Funder et al. 2002). Its timing must have been coincident with considerable deepening of the water depth and isotopic compositional changes signaled in foraminiferal assemblages of the Kattegat embayment (Seidenkranz, 1993: her Zone E; see also: Larsen et al.,2009). The onset of southerly marine deposition in formerly limnic deep waters of the West Baltic Basin, times relatively early (just 300 years into the Eemian; within Zagwijn PAZ E2b according to Madsen et al., 1908; Konradi, 1976; Kristensen et al., 2000). The early-Eemian brackish phase in the West Baltic Sea was a relatively short lived one: Saline stages of the Cyprina clay commence halfway PAZ E3a onwards, some 350 varve-years later when correlating to terrestrial sites some 250 km away (Kristensen et al. 2000:110, their local zone RKFO4). It is followed by two more stages (see other entries: first saline part: 'transgression', second saline part: 'high stand').

In the Kattegat, the deepening signal is registered soon as meltwater fluxes derived from Scandinavian ice and spillage from lakes occupying the Baltic basin stopped. On transgression mechanistic grounds (i.e: a connection is established) the deepening of the Kattegat waters (represented by Seidenkranz 1993 single Zone E) coincides with the deepening and salinization during Kristensen et al. (2000) pair of zones RKFO3 and RKFO4 in the Cyprina Clay distribution area to the south. From the onset of Zone E / Zone RKFO3 onwards, waves of immigration of boreal-to-lusitanic foram and mollusc species into the Baltic Sea basin begin. Deep water species reach the Baltic Sea from habitats in the Kattegat where foram and mollusc species compositional changes are also recorded. Shallow water species reach the Baltic Sea from littoral habitats of the Southern North Sea and around the Danish peninsula and islands (and may have arrived mainly during zone RKFO4).

This entry matches foraminifera zone RKFO4 as described in Kristensen et al., (2000) for the Cyprina Clay. 
This entry correlates chronostratigraphically to foraminiferal zone E as described by Seidenkranz (1993) in deep waters in the south of the Kattegat (palaeo)embayment.
This entry correlates chronostratigraphically to intervals at the base of the 'Lower Turritella terebra' molluscan zone of Larsen et al. (2009) in the centre of the Kattegat (palaeo)embayment: the lower parts of regional foraminiferal zone to N3 (AV-F3).

The part of the marine unit described here is the first fully saline unit, marks fully established marine exchange between the North Sea (Kattegat) and the Baltic Sea. The subunit overlies an initial brackish phases that in turn overly liminic strata. The connection with the Kattegat is evident from marine palynology (forams) and malacology (Kristensen et al., 2000; Funder et al., 2002). Saline stages of the Cyprina Clay in the West of the  Baltic Sea commence halfway PAZ E3a onwards (Kristensen et al. 2000:110, their local zone RKFO4), based on pollen content and correlation to terrestrial key sites with varve-based floating chronologies (see 'North Sea' Zagwijn entries). 

Deep water species reach the Baltic Sea from habitats in the Kattegat where foram and mollusc species compositional changes are also recorded. Shallow water species reach the Baltic Sea from littoral habitats of the Southern North Sea and around the Danish peninsula and islands. By the end of zone RKFO4 littoral lusitanian mollusc species have appeared in the West Baltic Sea. By the end of zone RKFO4 bottom-water subarctic and boreal relict faunal elements have disappeared in the West Baltic Sea.

The marine stage is coincident with considerable deepening of the water depth and isotopic compositional changes signaled in foraminiferal assemblages of the Kattegat embayment (Seidenkranz, 1993: her Zone E; see also: Larsen et al.,2009). This is the phase that more boreal-to-lusitanic foram and mollusc species make it to the Baltic Sea basin, mixing and replacing boreal and subarctic species. In the central baltic this includes replacement and competition with species introduced from the east through marine connections with the White Sea (reviewed by Funder et al., 2002) in Karelia (Russian-Finnish borderlands). 

The first saline parts of the unit are followed by a second saline stage, where foraminiferal composition changes (initially persisting subarctic/cold bottom water species get replaced by boreal/temperate water species; Kristensen et al., 2000:110, their local zone RKFO5) and additional indications of current change (Kristensen et al., 2000:113) indicate the Baltic Sea to have reached full depth ('high stand'). The break between RKFO4 and RKFO5 has a correlated timing halfway Zagwijn PAZ E4b (Kristensen et al., 2000). The ending of the 'transgressive' stage of this zone break correlates to the break between local foram zones E and F of Seidenkranz (1993) the deeper waters of the Kattegat to the north of the Cyprina clay distribution area.  

In the 'high stand' stage (not this entry), a secondary marine connection between North Sea (German Bight) and the West Baltic may have established across the Schleswig (Danish-German borderlands; sources in Konradi et al., 2005). Such offers further circumstantial explanation for the change in local oceanography registered by the marine palynology of RKFO4 and RKFO5 (Kristensen et al., 2000; Funder et al., 2002). This was reason to separate entries for the 'lower saline part' from the 'upper saline part' of the Cyprina clay when using it chronostratigraphically in this sea-level change oriented database.

This entry correlates chronostratigraphically to foraminiferal zone F as described by Seidenkranz (1993) in deep waters in the south of the Kattegat (palaeo)embayment.
This entry correlates chronostratigraphically to the main part of the 'Lower Turritella terebra' molluscan zone of Larsen et al. (2009) in the centre of the Kattegat (palaeo)embayment: the middle and upper parts of regional foraminiferal zone to N3 (AV-F3).

The part of the marine unit described here is the upper part of the unit, it marks the Eemian high stand stage in the West Baltic Sea, and follows transgressive stages (brackish onset and lower saline parts). In the upper saline stage, foraminiferal composition is mainly that of boreal/temperate water species including abundant Lusitanian species (Kristensen et al., 2000:110, their local zone RKFO5). Seidenkranz (1993: her Zone F) in the deeper waters of the Kattegat to the North of the Cyprina clay distribution area describes a foraminiferal compositional change that appears correlated. These conditions established halfway Zagwijn PAZ E4b, based on correlations to terrestrial sites some 250 km to the SW (Kristensen et al., 2000). For a good part of the duration of this upper saline stage, a secondary tidal marine connection between North Sea (German Bight) and the West Baltic may have functioned across Schleswig (Danish-German borderlands; sources in Konradi et al., 2005). 

The truncation of the top of the Cyprina clays, makes that a regressive signal in the fill of the Wisla (Weichsel) palaeovalley (incursed by the Baltic Sea in the Eemian), is more representative to date the end of marine high stand conditions in the West Baltic, than records obtained on the unit itself. The Wisla regressive record starting towards the end of PAZ E5 is known from site Nowiny in Poland (Makowska, 1986 op cit. Funder et al., 2002). In deeper parts of the Baltic sea basin, periglacial marine conditions prevail into the Early Weichselian (e.g. site Plasumi, Kalnina, 2001 op cit. Funder et al. 2002). Houmark-Nielsen (1987: 167) cites the sequence at North Danish site Skaerumhede (Kundsen & Lykke-Andersen, 1982) as Danish stratigraphic evidence for return from deeper 'Borea-Lusitanic' to shallower 'Boreal' conditions during ""a late Eemian/Early Weichselian regression"", recorded in deep waters of the Kattegat (see also Larsen et al., 2009). Seidenkranz (1993: her Zone G), further south but still in the Kattegat deep waters also record a foraminiferal change back to boreal compositions. Winn and Erlenkeuser (1995, 1998) record a similar change in shallower North Sea waters (site Dagebuell; above -15 m MSL; Schleswig coast).",1-2,Equal to,MIS 5e,see main entry for West Baltic Sea Cyprinia Clay,126.0,116.0,"see main entry on West Baltic Sea Cyprinia Clay

 Kristensen et al., 2000
 Larsen et al., 2009
 Seidenkranz, 1993","See the entry West Baltic Sea Cyprina clay for a full regional paleogeographical description.

The Kattegat Stadial as recognised and defined in marine deposits in NE Denmark (Seidenkranz, 1993: her Zones C, D1 and D2), marks a latest Saalian stage of marine deposition in the vicinity of meltwater outflow from Scandinavian sources. 

The Kattegat Stadial immediately precedes units showing considerable deepening of the water depth and isotopic compositional changes signaled in foraminiferal assemblages (Seidenkranz, 1993: her Zone E; see also: Larsen et al.,2009), that is the deep-water registration of terminated signals of meltwater fluxes, transgression (deepening of waters), climatic amelioration (warmer waters), altered marine connections, and marine biogeographic connection to southerly North Sea and English Channel waters (first Lusitanian species). For this reason, Seidenkranz' Zones E-F-G are correlated to the Eemian interglacial substages, while Zones A-B-C-D are regarded terminal stages of the Saalian glacial. Larsen et al. 2009 further review the marine deposits for mainland sites in North Denmark (Vendsyssel) where the marine sequence is much thicker (>70 m). Over there it stretches Latest Saalian ( Nuculana pernula N. minuta Zone ), Eemian ( Lower Turritella terebra Zone ), Early Weichselian ( Upper Turritella terebra Zone ) and Middle Weichselian intervals ( Abra nitida Zone, intercalated till units; Portlandia arctica Zone). The Nuculana pernula N. minuta Zone coincides/includes the Kattegat Stadial .

In this sequence Zone C-D represent a stadial / local meltwater pulse (Zone C the true pulse, zone D1/D2 the recovery). Zone B is a brief interstadial (Flakket interstadial), Zone A is a prior local meltwater pulse/stadial, representing retreat of Scandinavian ice front from the Kattegat deep waters (head of a fjord like structure in mesozoic and paleogene substratum, border zone to the Precambric substrate of mainland of Norway and Sweden; Houmark-Nielsen 1987; Seidenkranz, 1993; Larsen et al. 2009).

The isotopic signals from Zone A upto Zone E correlate broadly with the structure of Termination II (while Zone E to G would be the MIS5e plateau), although the vicinity of Scandinavian meltwater sources (melting ice sheets over Sweden; spillage of lake waters gathered in the deglaciating Baltic Sea basin) complicates direct correlation: Zone C-D could also be a local meltwater pulse timing late in Termination II. Seidenkranz (1993) correlates Zone B with the midpoint of the Termination (attributed an age of c. 131 ka; following Martinson et al. 1987; or alternatively: an age of ca. 132.5 based correlation to U/Th dated italian speleothem d18O, when following Tzedakis et al. 2018). Alternatively, the very base of the sequence could be tied to that moment. ",0.5,Equal to,MIS 5e,"see main description.

Transitional zone D2 may coincide with Zone E1 in the Southern North Sea. Zone E coincides with E2b based on finding of Kristensen et al. 2000 in the West Baltic Sea (very onset Cyprina clay) and the initiated (deep water) boreo-lusitanian biota immigration into the West Baltic Sea.

 Zagwijn, 1996","Note: This entry describes the entire Eemian interglacial, spanning six main pollen zones in the Zagwijn (1983, 1996) floating chronostratigraphic scheme. This main scheme covers a full interglacial forest succession, from onset (E1-E3) to climax (E4-E5) to decline (E6). Further entries are created for individual zones and subzones compliant to the absolute age-considerations documented here in this main entry, and repeated in the dataset description paper (Cohen et al. 2022). The entries are successively updated to include the correlated schemes of Zagwijn 1961 (Netherlands); Behre 1962, Selle 1962, Muller 1974 and Menke & Tynne 1984 (NW Germany), Jessen & Millers 1928 (Denmark and NW Germany) - discussions in Benda & Schneekloth, 1965; Gruger, 1989; Zagwijn, 1969; Funder et al., 2002. 

Succession of vegetation (arboreal pollen mostly), interglacial half cycle - recorded in lake fills and peats of various type (paraglacial negative relief, lagoonal inland rim, river channel fill). Several Zagwijn Netherlands' references (1961; 1983; 1996) and parallel palynological investigations in Western Germany (Behre 1962, Selle 1962, Muller 1974; Menke & Tynni 1984 - see Zagwijn 1996), building on pioneering work in Denmark (Jessen & Milthers 1928; Andersen 1965). Multiple later references regarding absolute timing and degree of diachronicity and (non-)analogy in regional succession and paleoclimatic zonal developments with the Lateglacial-Holocene half cycle, notably: Van Leeuwen et al., 2000; Cleveringa et al., 2000; Turner, 2002; Kukla et al. 2002; Beets & Beets, 2003; Beets et al. 2006; Lambeck et al., 2006; Sier et al., 2015; Long et al., 2015. These papers also discuss how the regional scheme could tie in global chronological schemes, most importantly the correlation to records from the Iberian shelf (Sanchez-Goni et al., 1999; Shackleton et al. 2002, 2003); the Greenland Ice core oxygen isotopes and dust records (Sirocko et al. 2005; NEEM community members 2013). With new data and revised dating insights for these sites, triggered from U/Th dated signals in Italian speleothem record (Tzedakis et al. 2018), positions taken in past papers were reevaluated as part of the data entry here (2021-2022). The entries are optimised for use in and along the Southern North Sea, e.g. the Amersfoort sites of Zagwijn, 1983; Kasse et al., 2022.. 

Thickness of the Eemian sequences varies considerably with setting. The key sites are meter-thick infills of negative relief in deglaciated terrains just inside the ice-margins of the Saalian glaciation (Drenthe and Warthe substages; correlated to MIS6 and 'PGM'). The southern coastline of the North Sea contains glaciogenic basins and valleys that were transgressed (Netherlands' sites Amsterdam basin. Amersfoort basin, Petten-Rutten Rhine valley-estuary). Such sites also exist in German-Danish-Polish North Sea and Baltic Sea Eemian paleocoasts (e.g. Zagwijn, 1983; Hoefle et al., 1986; Streif, 2004), and continuations to the White Sea through Finnish-Russian Federation terrains (e.g. Funder et al. 2002). Transgression events (although similarly diachronic as vegetation successions) in such circumstances can be given a timing within the biochronostratigrapical schemes.

Recognising the onset of the interglacial (zone E1: terminating zone LS, Late Saalian) is based on similarity of forest succession at the onset of the Holocene: temperate conditions reestablished, recorded terrestrially in The Netherlands and NW Germany and SW Denmark.  In Northeast Denmark, in the direct vicinity of the deglaciating Scandinavian ice front accommodating some meltwater discharge events just prior to the onset of the Eemian (Seidenkranz, 1993). 

Recognising the ending of the interglacial (Zone E6:  first zone suggesting climatic deterioration) is also based on pollen compositional  change. Not the break between E5/E6 is the end of the palynological interglacial, but the break between E6/EW (Early Weichselian), which recognition is based on loss of boreal forest at the temperate latitudes  of The Netherlands / Western Germany. This is a somewhat arbitrary historical decision, that has no younger analogue (as the current interglacial, Holocene+Anthropocene has yet to end, and is human disturbed).",0.5 to >30m,Equal to,"MIS 5e, MIS 5d",see Notes on age determination.,129.0,112.5,"Duration estimates adding up to c. 11,000 +/- 1,000 years exist that are based on cross-correlation to warved sites in lowlands of Northwest Germany (notably Muller, 1974) and in the Eifel mar-lakes in central west Germany (notably Sirocko et al., 2005: ELSA dataset). 

Absolute ages of the onset are based on correlation to marine isotope-staged records and their age models (in turn correlated to U/Th dated speleothem records and tuned). Ages of ending of the interglacial (E6/EW and E6/E5 pollen zonations) are based on correlations (using dust-records within palynologically well resolved lake-sequences) to Greenland Ice-core isotope records and  their age models (that are in turn correlated to U/Th dated speleothem records, and tuned). Sirocko et al. (2005) report 7700 varve years in ELSA record between ending of Eemian interglacial (LEAP event, E5/E6 break) and the onset of North Atlantic marine cold event C24 (is end of GIS-25, onset of GS-24 in Greenland ice core oxygen isotope and dust records) at c. 110 ka (age tentantive in NGRIP 2005 chronology, but now U/Th corroborated, Tzedakis et al. 2018 and sources therein: Antro del Corchia speleothems). This provides a numeric age tie point for the end of the Eemian pollen zonation scheme: E5/E6 break at 118 +/-2 ka. Other data and correlations, such as the mean values of >30 OSL dates (Peeters et al. 2017) also support to the idea that the E5/E6 boundary (at 120-116 ka) correlates to the MIS5e/5d marine boundary (c. 116 ka) and equivalent isotopic change in Greenland ice core (between 116-114 ka, +/- 1 ka). 

The palynological biochronostratigraphical Eemian of North West Europe can either be regarded to have started almost simultaneous, or somewhat after that recorded in southern Europe. Tzedakis et al. (2018) combining planktonic d18O records from the Iberian margin and U/Th dated speleothem records from Italy, establish interglacial conditions to have commenced 129 ka overthere. The same oxygen-isotope records also date the mid-point of Termination II to ca. 132.5 +/- 1 ka. These insights revised earlier positions taken in Sanchez-Goni et al. 1999; Shackleton et al. 2002; 2003; Turner 2002; Kukla et al. 2002 that had the onset of interglacial conditions over Iberia slightly later (e.g. mid-point Termination II ca. 131 ka +/- 2 ka; benthic d18O plateau at 128-127 ka; palynological interglacial thought to start c. 126 ka). 

Further modest diachronicity may be present between 'first temperate/interglacial-announcing vegetation returning' over the Iberian Peninsula and 'the forest succession setting on' in the North Sea basin/ NW Germany. This should especially be regarded the case in scenarios where the Scandinavian Ice Sheet (SIS) during MIS-6 and its PGM (Penultimate Glacial Maximum, SIS had submaxima at c. 160 ka and c. 140 ka), is regarded considerably larger and slower to melt away than in the LGM-Holocene (Last Glacial Maximum) counter example (Kukla 2000, Turner 2000: not explicit, but a few millennia; Lambeck et al. 2006: some 2-4 ka; Sier et al. 2015: as much as 6-7 ka; Long et al. 2015: scenario dependency). Sier et al. (2015) timed the onset of the paleomagnetic Blake event and the NW European Eemian to after marine cold events C27/C28, that have an age of c. 126 ka in the Tzedakis et al. (2018) chronology. 

All together maximum and minimum onset ages and durations of zones E1-E6 and its subzones can be formulated that encompass the main chronostratigraphic scenarios entertained in literature, updated to numeric dating constraints.
1) Zone E1 starts at 129 ka at the earliest, and at 125 ka at the latest (4000 years South-North diachroneity)
2) The E5/E6 transition times at 118 +/- 2 ka. E6 zone can be regarded to correlate with MIS5e-d, rather than to fall in MIS 5e.
3) E6/EW transition (c. 115-112 ka) occurs before onset of North Atlantic cold event C24 (c. 110 ka)

In filling the maximum and minimum age entries for subzones, the Mueller 1974 varve counts were regarded minimum durations. If E1-E5 span from 129-118 ka, the underestimation c. 60%. If E1-E5 spans from 126 to 118 ka, it is c. 19%. The underestimation would mainly be in zones E4-E5 (Muller 1974 estimated varve duration: 6800 years).

The advised slotting of the 'Zagwijn' palynological Eemian for this entry hence is 126+/-1 to 113+/-1 (with E5/E6 at 118 ka), i.e. adopting a scenario to the younger side, that allows for c. 3000 year of diachronicity in forest succession onset between South and North Europe and that allows for relatively slower Scandinavian deglaciation over Termination II compared to Termination I (Cohen et al. 2022).

Modest additional diachronicity in onset and differences in durations may apply to biostratigraphically correlated areas in Eastern Europe (Kukla et al. 2002; Funder et al. 2002). Such has been reason to make separate entries in this database for the 'Mikulinian' zonation scheme. Similarly, French and South English 'Atlantic' coastal sites may have a modestly earlier onset of the E1-E4a correlated stages, and modest differences in durations.

 Peeters et al., 2016","A Lower Rhine interglacial high-stand estuary is located in the NW of the Netherlands (Friesland province, western Wadden Sea). The estuarine system (meso-tidal based on modern analogue, supported by sedimentology) including a well preserved high stand/early regressive peat bed is mapped at depth immediately below glacigenic contacts. The estuary functioned up to the sea-level fall from MIS 7 into MIS 6. The area was then affected by glaciation (the estuary became till sheet covered) and drainage reorganisation (the Rhine never returned to an estuary with this orientation) during the Saalian Drenthe Substage (mid MIS-6, ca. 160-150 ka). Meijer & Cleveringa (2009) review the malacology and AAR aminostratigraphy of the Oostermeer interglacial compared to older and younger levels. The estuarine 'transgressive' and overlying coastal peat 'high stand' parts of the estuaries in the NW Netherlands have hosted type sites for the Oostermeer interglacial (following up on Zwartkruis-borehole interglacial described by Zagwijn & Van Staalduijnen 1975; see Meijer & Cleveringa 2002; 2009). That smaller estuary inherited its position from a tunnel valley of Elsterian age (glaciation during MIS 12 and/or 10).

70,1,West Baltic Sea Cyprina Clay E2b/E3a-E5/E6a ,"Buylaert et al., 2011
 Funder et al., 2002
 Houmark-Nielsen, 1987
 Konradi, 1976

 Larsen et al., 2009
 Madsen et al., 1908
 Seidenkranz, 1993
 Winn & Erlenkeuser, 1995
 Winn & Erlenkeuser, 1998","Based on phrasings in Funder et al. (2002): The Cyprina clay, named after Cyprina (now Arctica) islandica is a shell bearing marine clay that represents the last interglacial (Eemian) marine inundation of the west of the Baltic Sea - just south of the main connection with the North Sea (last interglacial representations of the present Kattegat and OreSund (Sont) and Stoerebelt straits), with ramifications for the salinity and currents/oxic water state (Funder et al., 2002).  

The clay is exposed in very much displaced position coastal cliffs in SE Denmark (notably: at Ristige Klint, Madsen et al. 1908:3-43,47-65, Kristensen et al. 2000; at Aero: Madsen et al. 1908:65-77) and N Germany with southern incursions near Lubeck and as far east as Ruegen and Usedom (Madsen et al., 1908; Konradi, 1976; Houmark-Nielsen, 1987; Winn and Erlenkeuser, 1998; Kubisch and Schoenfeld, 1985; Hoefle et al., 1985; Mueller et al., 1995; Ruehberg et al., 1995 - op. cit. Funder et al. 2002).

The lower contact is usually a drowning surface overlying limnic sand or clay (Baltic lake phases before the Eemian Transgression; 'shiny clay' and 'freshwater sand' in Kristensen et al., 2000). The Cyprina clay represents deposition in relative deeper waters in this part of the baltic basin. It has characteristic marine mollusc fauna, with the species Paphia aurea senescens (Tapes senescens in older literature; part of littoral Lusitanian fauna) in the middle part. This is the regionally Eemian-typical species in this clay (Jessen & Milthers, 1928; Miller & Mangerud, 1985; Kristensen et al., 2000; Funder et al., 2002). At site Gammelmarke, the clay grades into shoreface sand that is rich in shells, but usually the top is an erosive contact with glacial and/or glaciofluvial sediments (of Last Glacial age). In shallower sands the Eemian-typical species are Bittium reticulatum and Venerupis senescens (Miller & Mangerud, 1985; Funder et al. 2002).

The brackish onset of Cyprina clay sedimentation marks the establishment of a first tidal connection through the deep Alnarp-Esrum palaeovalley in the OreSund (Funder et al. 2002) and this times relatively early (just 300 years into the Eemian; within Zagwijn PAZ E2b according to Kristensen et al., 2000). Subsequent relatively more saline stages of the Cyprina clay (from halfway PAZ E3a onwards, some 350 varve-years later in nearby terrestrial sites; Kristensen et al. 2000:110, their local zone RKFO4) mark continuation of sea-level rise and establishment of full marine connection between North Sea and Baltic Sea basin through that palaeovalley primarily. North of the OreSund, in the Kattegat, Seidenkranz (1993) describes Late Saalian ice-marginal marine deposition directly overlying lodgement tills, and considerable warming and deepening of waters in the first part of the Eemian (her Zone E), which would correlate with this initial phase of the Cyprina clay deposition. 

Larsen et al. (2009) further review the marine deposits for mainland sites in North Denmark (Vendsyssel) where the marine sequence is much thicker (>70 m) and regional molluscan and foraminiferal zonations have been established. Over there the marine deposition stretches Latest Saalian ( Nuculana pernula N. minuta Molluscan Zone; Foraminiferal zone N4/AV-F2), Eemian ( Lower Turritella terebra Moluscan Zone, Foraminiferal zone N3/AV-F3), Early Weichselian ( Upper Turritella terebra Molluscan Zone; foraminiferal zone continued) and Middle Weichselian intervals ( Abra nitida and  Portlandia arctica Molluscan Zones; Foraminiferal zone N2/AV-F2); with glaciogenic separating and interrupting intervals). Their Lower Turritella terebra Zone correlates chronostratigraphically with the Cyprina clay. 

As the sea-level rose further and the water deepened, the salinity and temperature signals of the foraminiferal composition changes (subarctic/cold bottom water species replaced by boreal/temperate water species; Kristensen et al., 2000:110, their local zone RKFO5) and further indications of current change (Kristensen et al., 2000:113). This occurs some 1950 further (correlated) varve-years later (ibid., this is c. 2200 years after the onset brackish phase and 2500 years after the start of the Eemian; this is halfway Zagwijn PAZ E4b). At that stage a secondary marine connection across Schleswig may have established (Funder et al., 2002), as is suspected from geological mapping the dented inland extent of the Eemian high stand of the German Bight on the North Sea side (notably at site Schnittlohn, N Germany; Menke 1985; Knudsen 1985; Miller & Mangerud 1985), but the connection is not fully traced or proven (Kosack and Lange, 1985 and Schulz et al., 2001 - op cit. Konradi et al., 2005). Streif (2004) for Schleswig (=Danish-German border zone) indicates the shallowest occurence of Eemian marine deposits at -5 m NN on the North Sea side. In the deeper waters of the Kattegat, Seidenkranz (1993) reports foraminiferal change (her Zone F) which would coincide with this phase of the Cyprina clay.

The truncation of the top of the Cyprina clays, makes that a regressive signal in the fill of the Wisla (Weichsel) palaeovalley (incursed by the Baltic Sea in the Eemian), is more representative to date the end of marine high stand conditions in the West Baltic, than records obtained on the unit itself. The Wisla regressive record starting towards the end of PAZ E5 is known from site Nowiny in Poland (Makowska, 1986 op cit. Funder et al., 2002). In deeper parts of the Baltic sea basin, periglacial marine conditions prevail into the Early Weichselian (e.g. site Plasumi, Kalnina, 2001 op cit. Funder et al. 2002). Houmark-Nielsen (1987: 167) cites the sequence at North Danish site Skaerumhede I (Kundsen & Lykke-Andersen, 1982) as Danish stratigraphic evidence for return from deeper 'Borea-Lusitanic' to shallower 'Boreal' conditions during ""a late Eemian/Early Weichselian regression"", recorded in deep waters of the Kattegat (see also Larsen et al., 2009). Seidenkranz (1993: her Zone G), further south but still in the Kattegat deep waters also record a foraminiferal change back to boreal compositions. Winn and Erlenkeuser (1995) record a similar change in shallower North Sea waters (site Dagebuell; above -15 m MSL; Schleswig coast).
",2-4,Equal to,MIS 5e,"The marine unit occurs sandwiched between glacial and glacio-fluvial deposits from the last glacial (Weichselian) and the penultimate glacial (Saalian). In most locations it has been displaced from its original position by ice-pushing in the last glacial, causing it to outcrop in cliffs along the present Baltic Sea. It contains forams (zonations: Konradi, 1976; Funder et al. 2002) and could be used to obtain a regional marine oxygen isotope signal from. Winn & Erlenkeuser (1998) present results for several sites. For the Kattegat sound, where marine deposition began in the Late Saalian (Seidenkranz, 1993), and for a core in the German Bight (Winn & Erlenkeuser, 1995, 1998) isotopic studies are available, but this is outside the Cyprina clay distribution area.",128.0,116.0,"Note that the unit in many places is erosively truncated and actual duration represented may be smaller than that for an ideal locality that has not suffered truncation. The upper age is for such hypothetical untructated locations where the deep water cyprina clay would be fully preserved. At site Ristige Klint, for example. the actually represented duration is reckoned to be some 3500 years (Kristensen et al. 2000: Fig. 6). Littoral sites along the Baltic Coast in North Germany are more compete in recording the high stand duration (Winn & Erlenkeuser, 1998: sites Krummland and Tuschenbek).

Relative age within the Last Interglacial based on palynological correlations (see entry North Sea 'Zagwijn' Eemian Pollenzones E1-E6; see Kristensen et al., 2000; Funder et al., 2002) of limnic deposits immediately underlying the clay and samples within the clay (the classic location being Stensigmose, Jessen & Milthers, 1928:178-179; Miller & Mangerud 1995; op. cit. Kristensen et al. 2000), to nearby terrestrial sites onshore in Jutland and Schleswick-Holstein (mainland Denmark and N Germany) and the Bispingen varved site at 180 km distance in Lower Saxony (N Germany). The absolute age (conservative range) and a duration constraint (Bisplingen varve counts) are taken over from the entries for PAZ E2b (first brackish conditions at site Ristinge Klint cf.

The duration of the Cyprina clay from brackish onset to boreal regression is correlated to foraminiferal Zones E and F of Seidenkranz (1993), who attributes these c. 6000 years duration (these two estimates are regarded as internally consistent).

 Ryan et al., 2020","An sequence of uplifted marine terraces spanning the past ~700 ka with additional shallow marine sediments representing all high sea-level stages of the past 2.6 Ma. 
The marine terrace sequence has been constrained by fission track dating of the Rangitawa Tephra (c. 340 ka per Lowe, 2019) which mantles the Ararata Terrace of ~400 ka (MIS 11) and older terraces. 
Constraint also provided by AAR dates of wood samples from deposits underlying the Rangitawa Tephra and associated with the Brunswick (MIS 9), Ngarino (MIS 7), Rapanui (MIS 5e), and younger terraces, which provide minimum radiocarbon ages. The AAR overlying the Ararata Terrace was calibrated to determine numerical age for AAR D/L values. 
Additional constraint for the terraces is provided by identification of the Brunhes/Matuyama Booundary; the MIS 7 and younger terraces are constrained by composition of coverbeds (presence of loess units) and biostratigraphy (Beu and Edwards, 1984).",,,N/A,Quaternary highstand framework,,,,No,,,,,,Deirdre Ryan,Deirdre Ryan,2020-06-19 21:32:27
